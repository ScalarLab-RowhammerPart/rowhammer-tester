# LiteX Row Hammer Tester

The aim of this project is to provide a platform for testing the [DRAM "Row Hammer" vulnerability](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yoonguk/papers/kim-isca14.pdf).


## Setup

The setup consists of FPGA gateware and application side software.
The following diagram illustrates general system architecture.

The DRAM is connected to [LiteDRAM](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litedram) which provides swappable PHYs and a DRAM controller implementation.

In the default bulk transfer mode the LiteDRAM controller is connected to PHY and ensures correct DRAM traffic.
Bulk transfers can be controlled using dedicated Control & Status Registers (CSRs) and use LiteDRAM DMA to ensure fast operation.

Payload Executor allows to execute a user-provide sequence of commands.
It temporarily disconnects the DRAM controller from PHY, executes the instructions stored in an SRAM memory
translating them into DFI commands and finally reconnects the DRAM controller.

The application side consists of a set of Python scripts communicating with the FPGA using the LiteX EtherBone bridge.
